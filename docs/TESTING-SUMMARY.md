## 🚀 Quick Start Testing

### 1️⃣ First Time Setup (5 minutes)

```bash
# Validate environment
npm run validate:env

# Validate all services
npm run validate:clerk
npm run validate:supabase
npm run validate:upstash
npm run validate:ai
```

### 2️⃣ Before Every Deployment (10 minutes)

```bash
# Run comprehensive pre-deployment test
npm run test:pre-deploy
```

### 3️⃣ During Development (continuous)

```bash
# Terminal 1: Dev server
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Watch tests
npm run test:watch
```

---

## 🎯 Testing Levels

### Level 1: Environment Validation ⚡ (2-5 min)

**Purpose:** Verify all API keys and services are configured correctly.

```bash
npm run validate:env
```

**What it checks:**
- ✅ `.env.local` exists
- ✅ Required variables set (not placeholders)
- ✅ Critical services configured

**When to run:**
- First-time setup
- After changing environment variables
- When deployment fails

---

### Level 2: Service Connectivity 🔌 (2-5 min)

**Purpose:** Test actual connections to external services.

```bash
npm run validate:clerk      # Authentication
npm run validate:supabase   # Database
npm run validate:upstash    # Redis/Vector/QStash
npm run validate:ai         # LLM providers
npm run validate:security   # Arcjet
npm run validate:monitoring # Sentry
```

**What it checks:**
- ✅ API keys are valid
- ✅ Services are accessible
- ✅ Authentication works

**When to run:**
- After environment validation
- When API calls fail
- When services are updated

---

### Level 3: Manual Feature Testing 🖱️ (15-30 min)

**Purpose:** Verify core features work end-to-end.

**Test areas:**
1. **Authentication** - Sign up, sign in, organizations
2. **AI Chat** - Streaming responses, AG-UI protocol
3. **Knowledge Base** - Upload, process, search documents
4. **Database** - Tables exist, RLS policies, data persists

**When to run:**
- First-time setup
- After major changes
- Before production deployment

**See:** [TESTING-GUIDE.md](../TESTING-GUIDE.md) Section 2

---

### Level 4: Automated Tests 🤖 (5-10 min)

**Purpose:** Run automated test suites.

```bash
# Unit tests
npm test

# Integration tests
npm run test:integration

# Type checking
npm run type-check

# Linting
npm run lint

# Production build
npm run build
```

**When to run:**
- Before every commit (automatic via Husky)
- Before deployment
- After code changes

---

### Level 5: Pre-Deployment Test 🚀 (10-15 min)

**Purpose:** Comprehensive validation before deployment.

```bash
npm run test:pre-deploy
```

**What it runs:**
- ✅ Phase 1: Environment validation
- ✅ Phase 2: Service connectivity
- ✅ Phase 3: Authentication E2E (CRITICAL)
- ✅ Phase 4: AG-UI SDK integration (CRITICAL)
- ✅ Phase 5: Unit tests
- ✅ Phase 6: Integration tests
- ⚠️ Phase 7: Full E2E suite (if configured)
- ⚠️ Phase 8: Load tests (if K6 installed)
- ✅ Phase 9: Security scan

**When to run:**
- Before every deployment
- After major changes
- Weekly (recommended)
